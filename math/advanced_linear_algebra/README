## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to confidently explain the following concepts without external assistance:

### ðŸ”· General

- **Determinant**  
  Understand what a determinant is and how to compute it for square matrices using various methods (e.g., Laplace expansion, row reduction).

- **Minor, Cofactor, and Adjugate**  
  Be able to define and compute:
  - **Minor**: The determinant of a smaller matrix formed by removing one row and one column.
  - **Cofactor**: A signed minor used in matrix operations.
  - **Adjugate**: The transpose of the cofactor matrix.

- **Matrix Inverse**  
  Know what the inverse of a matrix is, when a matrix is invertible, and how to compute it using methods such as:
  - Adjugate and determinant
  - Row reduction (Gauss-Jordan elimination)

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**  
  Understand the definitions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and how to compute them by solving:
  - The characteristic equation: `det(A - Î»I) = 0`
  - The corresponding eigenvector equations: `(A - Î»I)v = 0`

- **Definiteness of a Matrix**  
  Understand the types of definiteness (positive definite, negative definite, semi-definite, indefinite) and how to determine a matrix's definiteness using:
  - Leading principal minors
  - Eigenvalue analysis
