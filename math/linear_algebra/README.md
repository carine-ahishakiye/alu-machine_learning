# Linear Algebra Learning Objectives

This project covers the fundamental concepts of linear algebra essential for machine learning and data science.

## What You Will Learn

- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector or matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors or matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?

## Overview

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain these concepts clearly without needing to look them up. This will help you build a strong foundation for further studies in machine learning.
