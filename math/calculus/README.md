## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔢 What is a Series?
A **series** is the sum of the terms of a sequence. It can be:
- **Finite**, where only a limited number of terms are added.
- **Infinite**, where terms are added indefinitely, often using the summation symbol (∑).

**Example:**
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

---

### ∑ **Summation Notation**
Summation notation uses the symbol **∑** to represent the addition of a sequence of terms.

**Example:**
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} k^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 30
\]

---

### ∏ **Product Notation**
Product notation uses the symbol **∏** to represent the product of a sequence of terms.

**Example:**
\[
\prod_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24
\]

---

### 🔁 Common Series
- **Arithmetic Series**: Difference between terms is constant.
- **Geometric Series**: Ratio between terms is constant.
- **Harmonic Series**: Terms are reciprocals of integers.

---

### 📉 What is a Derivative?
A **derivative** measures the rate at which a function changes with respect to its input.

**Notation:**
\[
f'(x), \frac{dy}{dx}, Df(x)
\]

---

### ✏️ What is the Product Rule?
Used to differentiate the product of two functions.

**Formula:**
\[
(uv)' = u'v + uv'
\]

---

### 🔗 What is the Chain Rule?
Used to differentiate a composite function.

**Formula:**
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
\]

---

### 📜 Common Derivative Rules
- **Power Rule**: \(\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}\)
- **Constant Rule**: \(\frac{d}{dx}c = 0\)
- **Sum Rule**: \(\frac{d}{dx}(f + g) = f' + g'\)
- **Exponential**: \(\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x\)

---

### ∂ What is a Partial Derivative?
A **partial derivative** is a derivative taken with respect to one variable while keeping the others constant in multivariable functions.

**Notation:** \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\)

---

### ∫ What is an Indefinite Integral?
An **indefinite integral** represents a family of functions whose derivative is the integrand.

**Example:**
\[
\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
\]

---

### 📐 What is a Definite Integral?
A **definite integral** calculates the signed area under a curve over an interval \([a, b]\).

**Example:**
\[
\int_0^2 x dx = 2
\]

---

### 🔁 What is a Double Integral?
A **double integral** computes the volume under a surface in a 2D region.

**Example:**
\[
\iint_R f(x, y) \,dx\,dy
\]
