## ðŸ“Œ What is a Plot?

A **plot** is a graphical representation of data. It helps in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset. Plots are essential in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning for visualizing and communicating information.

## ðŸ“ˆ Types of Plots

### ðŸ”¹ Scatter Plot
A **scatter plot** displays individual data points as dots in a 2D space. It's useful for visualizing relationships or correlations between two variables.

### ðŸ”¹ Line Graph
A **line graph** connects data points with a continuous line, often used to show trends over time.

### ðŸ”¹ Bar Graph
A **bar graph** represents categorical data with rectangular bars. The height or length of the bar corresponds to the value it represents.

### ðŸ”¹ Histogram
A **histogram** shows the distribution of numerical data by grouping values into bins. It's useful for identifying the shape and spread of the data.
